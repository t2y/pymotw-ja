Python Module of the Week
=========================

PyMOTW is a series of blog posts written by `Doug Hellmann <http://www.doughellmann.com/>`_.  It was started as a way to build the habit of writing something on a regular basis.  The focus of the series is building a set of example code for the modules in the `Python <http://www.python.org/>`_ standard library.

Translations and Other Versions
===============================

Chinese
-------

Junjie Cai (蔡俊杰) and Yan Sheng (盛艳) have started a google code project called PyMOTWCN (http://code.google.com/p/pymotwcn/) and posted the completed translations at http://www.vbarter.cn/pymotw/.

German
------

Ralf Schönian is translating PyMOTW into German, following an alphabetical order.  The results are available on his web site, http://schoenian-online.de/pymotw.html.  Ralf is an active member of the `pyCologne <http://wiki.python.de/User_Group_K%C3%B6ln?action=show&redirect=pyCologne>`_ user group in Germany and author of pyVoc, the open source English/German vocabulary trainer (http://code.google.com/p/pyvoc/).


Spanish
-------

`Ernesto Rico Schmidt <http://denklab.org/>`_ provides a Spanish translation that follows the English version posts. Ernesto is in Bolivia, and is translating these examples as a way to contribute to the members of the `Bolivian Free Software <http://www.softwarelibre.org.bo/>`_ community who use Python.   The full list of articles available in Spanish can be found at http://denklab.org/articles/category/pymotw/, and there is an `RSS feed <http://denklab.org/feeds/articles/category/pymotw/>`_.


Compendiums
-----------

Gerard Flanagan is working on a "Python compendium" called `The Hazel Tree <http://www.thehazeltree.org/>`_.  He is converting a collection of old and new of Python-related reference material into reStructuredText and then building a single searchable repository from the results.  I am very pleased to have PyMOTW included with works from authors like Mark Pilgrim, Fredrik Lundh, Andrew Kuchling, and a growing list of others.
