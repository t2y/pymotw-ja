hashlib -- Cryptographic hashes and message digests
===================================================

.. module:: hashlib
    :synopsis: Cryptographic hashes and message digests

:Purpose: Cryptographic hashes and message digests
:Python Version: 2.5

The hashlib module deprecates the separate :mod:`md5` and :mod:`sha`
modules and makes their API consistent. To work with a specific hash
algorithm, use the appropriate constructor function to create a hash
object. Then you can use the same API to interact with the hash no
matter what algorithm is being used.

Since hashlib is "backed" by OpenSSL, all of of the algorithms provided by
that library should be available, including:

 * md5
 * sha1
 * sha224
 * sha256
 * sha384
 * sha512

Sample Data
===========

All of the examples below use the same sample data:

.. include:: hashlib_data.py
    :literal:
    :start-after: #end_pymotw_header


MD5 Example
===========

To calculate the MD5 digest for a block of data (here an ASCII string), create
the hash, add the data, and compute the digest. 

.. include:: hashlib_md5.py
    :literal:
    :start-after: #end_pymotw_header

This example uses the ``hexdigest()`` method instead of ``digest()``
because the output is formatted to be printed. If a binary digest
value is acceptable, you can use ``digest()``.

.. {{{cog
.. cog.out(run_script(cog.inFile, 'hashlib_md5.py'))
.. }}}
.. {{{end}}}

SHA1 Example
============

A SHA1 digest for the same data would be calculated in much the same way.

.. include:: hashlib_sha1.py
    :literal:
    :start-after: #end_pymotw_header

Of course, the digest value is different because of the different algorithm.

.. {{{cog
.. cog.out(run_script(cog.inFile, 'hashlib_sha1.py'))
.. }}}
.. {{{end}}}


new()
=====

Sometimes it is more convenient to refer to the algorithm by name in a
string rather than by using the constructor function directly. It is
useful, for example, to be able to store the hash type in a
configuration file. In those cases, use ``new()`` to create a hash
calculator.

.. include:: hashlib_new.py
    :literal:
    :start-after: #end_pymotw_header

When run with a variety of arguments:

.. {{{cog
.. cog.out(run_script(cog.inFile, 'hashlib_new.py sha1'))
.. cog.out(run_script(cog.inFile, 'hashlib_new.py sha256', include_prefix=False))
.. cog.out(run_script(cog.inFile, 'hashlib_new.py sha512', include_prefix=False))
.. cog.out(run_script(cog.inFile, 'hashlib_new.py md5', include_prefix=False))
.. }}}
.. {{{end}}}


Calling update() more than once
===============================

The ``update()`` method of the hash calculators can be called
repeatedly. Each time, the digest is updated based on the additional
text fed in. This can be much more efficient than reading an entire
file into memory, for example.

.. include:: hashlib_update.py
    :literal:
    :start-after: #end_pymotw_header

This example is a little contrived because it works with such a small amount
of text, but it illustrates how you could incrementally update a digest as
data is read or otherwise produced.

.. {{{cog
.. cog.out(run_script(cog.inFile, 'hashlib_update.py'))
.. }}}
.. {{{end}}}
