:mod:`sys` includes low-level functions for controlling and debugging thread behavior.

Check Interval
==============

Python uses a form of cooperative multitasking in its thread implementation.  At a fixed interval, bytecode execution is paused and the interpreter checks if any signal handlers need to be executed.  During the same interval check, the global interpreter lock is also released by the current thread and then reacquired, giving other threads an opportunity to take over execution by grabbing the lock first.

The default check interval is 100 bytecodes and the current value can always be retrieved with ``sys.getcheckinterval()``.  Changing the interval with ``sys.setcheckinterval()`` may have an impact on the performance of your application, depending on the nature of the operations being performed.

.. include:: sys_checkinterval.py
    :literal:
    :start-after: #end_pymotw_header

When the check interval is smaller than the number of bytecodes in a thread, the interpreter may give another thread control so that it runs for a while.  This is illustrated in the first set of output where the check interval is set to 100 (the default) and 1000 extra loop iterations are performed for each step through the ``i`` loop.

On the other hand, when the check interval is *greater* than the number of bytecodes being executed by a thread that doesn't release control for another reason, the thread will finish its work before the interval comes up.  This is illustrated by the order of the name values in the queue in the second example.

Modifying the check interval is not as clearly useful as it might seem.  Many other factors may control the context switching behavior of Python's threads.  For example, if a thread performs I/O, it releases the GIL and may therefore allow another thread to take over execution.

.. include:: sys_checkinterval_io.py
    :literal:
    :start-after: #end_pymotw_header

This example is modified from the first so that the thread prints directly to ``sys.stdout`` instead of appending to a queue.  The output is much less predictable.
