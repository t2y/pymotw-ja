threading -- Manage concurrent threads
======================================

.. module:: threading
    :synopsis: Manage several concurrent threads of execution.

:Purpose: Builds on the :mod:`thread` module to more easily manage several threads of execution.
:Python Version: 1.5.2 and later

The :mod:`threading` module builds on the low-level features of
:mod:`thread` to make working with threads even easier and more
*pythonic*. Using threads allows a program to run multiple operations
concurrently in the same process space.

Thread Objects
==============

The simplest way to use a :class:`Thread` is to instantiate it with a
target function and call :func:`start()` to let it begin working.

.. include:: threading_simple.py
    :literal:
    :start-after: #end_pymotw_header

The output is five lines with ``"Worker"`` on each:

::

	$ python threading_simple.py

	Worker
	Worker
	Worker
	Worker
	Worker

It useful to be able to spawn a thread and pass it arguments to tell
it what work to do. This example passes a number, which the thread
then prints.

.. include:: threading_simpleargs.py
    :literal:
    :start-after: #end_pymotw_header

The integer argument is now included in the message printed by each
thread:

::

	$ python -u threading_simpleargs.py
    
    Worker: 0
    Worker: 1
    Worker: 2
    Worker: 3
    Worker: 4


Determining the Current Thread
==============================

Using arguments to identify or name the thread is cumbersome, and
unnecessary.  Each :class:`Thread` instance has a name with a default
value that can be changed as the thread is created. Naming threads is
useful in server processes with multiple service threads handling
different operations.

.. include:: threading_names.py
    :literal:
    :start-after: #end_pymotw_header

The debug output includes the name of the current thread on each
line. The lines with ``"Thread-1"`` in the thread name column
correspond to the unnamed thread :data:`w2`.

.. {{{cog
.. cog.out(run_script(cog.inFile, '-u threading_names.py'))
.. }}}
.. {{{end}}}

Most programs do not use :command:`print` to debug. The
:mod:`logging` module supports embedding the thread name in every log
message using the formatter code ``%(threadName)s``. Including thread
names in log messages makes it easier to trace those messages back to
their source.

.. include:: threading_names_log.py
    :literal:
    :start-after: #end_pymotw_header

:mod:`logging` is also thread-safe, so messages from different threads
are kept distinct in the output.

.. {{{cog
.. cog.out(run_script(cog.inFile, 'threading_names_log.py'))
.. }}}
.. {{{end}}}

Daemon vs. Non-Daemon Threads
=============================

Up to this point, the example programs have implicitly waited to exit
until all threads have completed their work. Sometimes programs spawn
a thread as a *daemon* that runs without blocking the main program
from exiting. Using daemon threads is useful for services where there
may not be an easy way to interrupt the thread or where letting the
thread die in the middle of its work does not lose or corrupt data
(for example, a thread that generates "heart beats" for a service
monitoring tool). To mark a thread as a daemon, call its
:func:`setDaemon()` method with a boolean argument. The default is for
threads to not be daemons, so passing True turns the daemon mode on.

.. include:: threading_daemon.py
    :literal:
    :start-after: #end_pymotw_header

Notice that the output does not include the ``"Exiting"`` message from
the daemon thread, since all of the non-daemon threads (including the
main thread) exit before the daemon thread wakes up from its two second
sleep.

.. {{{cog
.. cog.out(run_script(cog.inFile, 'threading_daemon.py'))
.. }}}
.. {{{end}}}

To wait until a daemon thread has completed its work, use the
:func:`join()` method.

.. include:: threading_daemon_join.py
    :literal:
    :start-after: #end_pymotw_header

Waiting for the daemon thread to exit using :func:`join()` means it
has a chance to produce its ``"Exiting"`` message.

.. {{{cog
.. cog.out(run_script(cog.inFile, 'threading_daemon_join.py'))
.. }}}
.. {{{end}}}

By default, :func:`join()` blocks indefinitely. It is also possible to
pass a timeout argument (a float representing the number of seconds to
wait for the thread to become inactive). If the thread does not
complete within the timeout period, :func:`join()` returns anyway.

.. include:: threading_daemon_join_timeout.py
    :literal:
    :start-after: #end_pymotw_header

Since the timeout passed is less than the amount of time the daemon
thread sleeps, the thread is still "alive" after :func:`join()`
returns.

.. {{{cog
.. cog.out(run_script(cog.inFile, 'threading_daemon_join_timeout.py'))
.. }}}
.. {{{end}}}

Enumerating All Threads
=======================

It is not necessary to retain an explicit handle to all of the daemon
threads in order to ensure they have completed before exiting the main
process. :func:`enumerate()` returns a list of active :class:`Thread`
instances. The list includes the current thread, and since joining the
current thread is not allowed (it introduces a deadlock situation), it
must be skipped.

.. include:: threading_enumerate.py
    :literal:
    :start-after: #end_pymotw_header

Since the worker is sleeping for a random amount of time, the output
from this program may vary. It should look something like this:

.. {{{cog
.. cog.out(run_script(cog.inFile, 'threading_enumerate.py'))
.. }}}
.. {{{end}}}

Subclassing Thread
==================

At start-up, a :class:`Thread` does some basic initialization and then
calls its :func:`run()` method, which calls the target function passed
to the constructor. To create a subclass of :class:`Thread`, override
:func:`run()` to do whatever is necessary.

.. include:: threading_subclass.py
    :literal:
    :start-after: #end_pymotw_header

The return value of :func:`run` is ignored.

.. {{{cog
.. cog.out(run_script(cog.inFile, 'threading_subclass.py'))
.. }}}
.. {{{end}}}

Because the *args* and *kwargs* values passed to the :class:`Thread`
constructor are saved in private variables, they are not easily
accessed from a subclass.  To pass arguments to a custom thread type,
redefine the constructor to save the values in an instance attribute
that can be seen in the subclass.

.. include:: threading_subclass_args.py
   :literal:
   :start-after: #end_pymotw_header

:class:`MyThreadWithArgs` uses the same API as :class:`Thread`, but
another class could easily change the constructor method to take more
or different arguments more directly related to the purpose of the
thread, as with any other class.

.. {{{cog
.. cog.out(run_script(cog.inFile, 'threading_subclass_args.py'))
.. }}}
.. {{{end}}}


Timer Threads
=============

One example of a reason to subclass :class:`Thread` is provided by
:class:`Timer`, also included in :mod:`threading`. A :class:`Timer`
starts its work after a delay, and can be canceled at any point within
that delay time period.

.. include:: threading_timer.py
    :literal:
    :start-after: #end_pymotw_header

Notice that the second timer is never run, and the first timer appears
to run after the rest of the main program is done. Since it is not a
daemon thread, it is joined implicitly when the main thread is done.

.. {{{cog
.. cog.out(run_script(cog.inFile, 'threading_timer.py'))
.. }}}
.. {{{end}}}

Signaling Between Threads
=========================

Although the point of using multiple threads is to spin separate
operations off to run concurrently, there are times when it is
important to be able to synchronize the operations in two or more
threads. A simple way to communicate between threads is using
:class:`Event` objects. An :class:`Event` manages an internal flag
that callers can either :func:`set()` or :func:`clear()`. Other
threads can :func:`wait()` for the flag to be :func:`set()`,
effectively blocking progress until allowed to continue.

.. include:: threading_event.py
    :literal:
    :start-after: #end_pymotw_header

The :func:`wait` method takes an argument representing the number of
seconds to wait for the event before timing out.  It returns a boolean
indicating whether or not the event is set, so the caller knows why
:func:`wait` returned.  The :func:`isSet` method can be used
separately on the event without fear of blocking.

In this example, :func:`wait_for_event_timeout` checks the event
status without blocking indefinitely.  The :func:`wait_for_event`
blocks on the call to :func:`wait`, which does not return until the
event status changes.

.. {{{cog
.. cog.out(run_script(cog.inFile, 'threading_event.py'))
.. }}}
.. {{{end}}}

Controlling Access to Resources
===============================

In addition to synchronizing the operations of threads, it is also
important to be able to control access to shared resources to prevent
corruption or missed data. Python's built-in data structures (lists,
dictionaries, etc.) are thread-safe as a side-effect of having atomic
byte-codes for manipulating them (the GIL is not released in the
middle of an update). Other data structures implemented in Python, or
simpler types like integers and floats, don't have that protection. To
guard against simultaneous access to an object, use a :class:`Lock`
object.

.. include:: threading_lock.py
    :literal:
    :start-after: #end_pymotw_header

In this example, the :func:`worker()` function increments a
:class:`Counter` instance, which manages a :class:`Lock` to prevent
two threads from changing its internal state at the same time. If the
:class:`Lock` was not used, there is a possibility of missing a change
to the value attribute.

.. {{{cog
.. cog.out(run_script(cog.inFile, 'threading_lock.py'))
.. }}}
.. {{{end}}}

To find out whether another thread has acquired the lock without
holding up the current thread, pass False for the *blocking* argument
to :func:`acquire()`. In the next example, :func:`worker()` tries to
acquire the lock three separate times, and counts how many attempts it
has to make to do so. In the mean time, :func:`lock_holder` cycles
between holding and releasing the lock, with short pauses in each
state used to simulate load.

.. include:: threading_lock_noblock.py
    :literal:
    :start-after: #end_pymotw_header

It takes :func:`worker` more than three iterations to acquire the lock
three separate times.

.. {{{cog
.. cog.out(run_script(cog.inFile, 'threading_lock_noblock.py'))
.. }}}
.. {{{end}}}

Re-entrant Locks
----------------

Normal :class:`Lock` objects cannot be acquired more than once, even
by the same thread. This can introduce undesirable side-effects if a
lock is accessed by more than one function in the same call chain.

.. include:: threading_lock_reacquire.py
    :literal:
    :start-after: #end_pymotw_header

In this case, since both functions are using the same global lock, and
one calls the other, the second acquisition fails and would have
blocked using the default arguments to :func:`acquire()`.

.. {{{cog
.. cog.out(run_script(cog.inFile, 'threading_lock_reacquire.py'))
.. }}}
.. {{{end}}}

In a situation where separate code from the same thread needs to
"re-acquire" the lock, use an :class:`RLock` instead.

.. include:: threading_rlock.py
    :literal:
    :start-after: #end_pymotw_header

The only change to the code from the previous example was substituting
:class:`RLock` for :class:`Lock`.

.. {{{cog
.. cog.out(run_script(cog.inFile, 'threading_rlock.py'))
.. }}}
.. {{{end}}}

Locks as Context Managers
-------------------------

Locks implement the context manager API and are compatible with the
:command:`with` statement.  Using :command:`with` removes the need to
explicitly acquire and release the lock.

.. include:: threading_lock_with.py
    :literal:
    :start-after: #end_pymotw_header

The two functions :func:`worker_with()` and :func:`worker_no_with()`
manage the lock in equivalent ways.

.. {{{cog
.. cog.out(run_script(cog.inFile, 'threading_lock_with.py'))
.. }}}
.. {{{end}}}

Synchronizing Threads
=====================

In addition to using :class:`Events`, another way of synchronizing
threads is through using a :class:`Condition` object. Because the
:class:`Condition` uses a :class:`Lock`, it can be tied to a shared
resource. This allows threads to wait for the resource to be updated.
In this example, the :func:`consumer()` threads :func:`wait()` for the
:class:`Condition` to be set before continuing. The :func:`producer()`
thread is responsible for setting the condition and notifying the
other threads that they can continue.

.. include:: threading_condition.py
    :literal:
    :start-after: #end_pymotw_header

The threads use :command:`with` to acquire the lock associated with
the :class:`Condition`. Using the :func:`acquire()` and
:func:`release()` methods explicitly also works.

.. {{{cog
.. cog.out(run_script(cog.inFile, 'threading_condition.py'))
.. }}}
.. {{{end}}}

Limiting Concurrent Access to Resources
=======================================

Sometimes it is useful to allow more than one worker access to a
resource at a time, while still limiting the overall number. For
example, a connection pool might support a fixed number of
simultaneous connections, or a network application might support a
fixed number of concurrent downloads. A :class:`Semaphore` is one way
to manage those connections.

.. include:: threading_semaphore.py
    :literal:
    :start-after: #end_pymotw_header

In this example, the :class:`ActivePool` class simply serves as a
convenient way to track which threads are able to run at a given
moment. A real resource pool would allocate a connection or some other
value to the newly active thread, and reclaim the value when the
thread is done. Here it is just used to hold the names of the active
threads to show that only five are running concurrently.

.. {{{cog
.. cog.out(run_script(cog.inFile, 'threading_semaphore.py'))
.. }}}
.. {{{end}}}

Thread-specific Data
====================

While some resources need to be locked so multiple threads can use
them, others need to be protected so that they are hidden from view in
threads that do not "own" them. The :func:`local()` function creates
an object capable of hiding values from view in separate threads.

.. include:: threading_local.py
    :literal:
    :start-after: #end_pymotw_header

Notice that ``local_data.value`` is not present for any thread until
it is set in that thread.

.. {{{cog
.. cog.out(run_script(cog.inFile, 'threading_local.py'))
.. }}}
.. {{{end}}}

To initialize the settings so all threads start with the same value,
use a subclass and set the attributes in :func:`__init__`.

.. include:: threading_local_defaults.py
    :literal:
    :start-after: #end_pymotw_header

:func:`__init__` is invoked on the same object (note the :func:`id`
value), once in each thread.

.. {{{cog
.. cog.out(run_script(cog.inFile, 'threading_local_defaults.py'))
.. }}}
.. {{{end}}}
