traceback -- Extract, format, and print exceptions and stack traces.

.. module:: traceback
    :synopsis: Extract, format, and print exceptions and stack traces.

:Purpose: Extract, format, and print exceptions and stack traces.
:Python Version: 1.4 and later, with modifications over time

The traceback module works with the call stack to produce error messages. A
traceback is a stack trace from the point of an exception handler down the
call chain to the point where the exception was raised. You can also work with
the current call stack up from the point of a call (and without the context of
an error), which is useful for finding out the paths being followed into a
function.

The functions in the traceback module fall into several common categories.
There are functions for extracting raw tracebacks from the current runtime
environment (either an exception handler for a traceback, or the regular
stack). The extracted stack trace is a sequence of tuples containing the
filename, line number, function name, and text of the source line.

Once extracted, the stack trace can be formatted using functions like
format_exception, format_stack, etc. The format functions return a list of
strings with messages formatted to be printed. There are shorthand functions
for printing the formatted values, as well.

Although the functions in traceback mimic the behavior of the interactive
interpreter by default, they also are useful for handling exceptions in
situations where dumping the full stack trace to stderr is not desirable. For
example, a web application may need to format the traceback so it looks good
in HTML. An IDE may convert the elements of the stack trace into a clickable
list that lets the user browse the source. 

Supporting Functions
====================

The examples below use the module traceback_example.py (provided in the source
package for PyMOTW). The contents are:

.. include:: traceback_example.py
    :literal:
    :start-after: #end_pymotw_header


Working With Exceptions
=======================

The simplest way to handle exception reporting is with print_exc(). It uses
sys.exc_info() to obtain the exception information for the current thread,
formats the results, and prints the text to a file handle (sys.stderr, by
default).

.. include:: traceback_print_exc.py
    :literal:
    :start-after: #end_pymotw_header


In this example, the file handle for sys.stdout is substituted so the
informational and traceback messages are mingled correctly:

.. {{{cog
.. cog.out(run_script(cog.inFile, 'traceback_print_exc.py'))
.. }}}
.. {{{end}}}

print_exc() is just a shortcut for print_exception(), which requires explicit
arguments:

.. include:: traceback_print_exception.py
    :literal:
    :start-after: #end_pymotw_header

.. {{{cog
.. cog.out(run_script(cog.inFile, 'traceback_print_exception.py'))
.. }}}
.. {{{end}}}


And print_exception() uses format_exception():

.. include:: traceback_format_exception.py
    :literal:
    :start-after: #end_pymotw_header

.. {{{cog
.. cog.out(run_script(cog.inFile, 'traceback_format_exception.py'))
.. }}}
.. {{{end}}}


Working With the Stack
======================

There are a similar set of functions for performing the same operations with
the current call stack instead of a traceback. 

print_stack()
-------------

.. include:: traceback_print_stack.py
    :literal:
    :start-after: #end_pymotw_header

.. {{{cog
.. cog.out(run_script(cog.inFile, 'traceback_print_stack.py'))
.. }}}
.. {{{end}}}

format_stack()
--------------

.. include:: traceback_format_stack.py
    :literal:
    :start-after: #end_pymotw_header

.. {{{cog
.. cog.out(run_script(cog.inFile, 'traceback_format_stack.py'))
.. }}}
.. {{{end}}}

extract_stack()
---------------

.. include:: traceback_extract_stack.py
    :literal:
    :start-after: #end_pymotw_header

.. {{{cog
.. cog.out(run_script(cog.inFile, 'traceback_extract_stack.py'))
.. }}}
.. {{{end}}}

    :mod:`sys`
        The sys module includes singletons that hold the current exception.

    :mod:`inspect`
        The inspect module includes other functions for probing the frames on the stack.
