About Python Module of the Week
===============================

PyMOTW is a series of blog posts written by `Doug Hellmann <http://www.doughellmann.com/>`_.  It was started as a way to build the habit of writing something on a regular basis.  The focus of the series is building a set of example code for the modules in the `Python <http://www.python.org/>`_ standard library.

See the project home page at http://www.doughellmann.com/PyMOTW/ for updates and the latest release.

Complete documentation for the standard library can be found on the Python web site at http://docs.python.org/library/contents.html.

Tools
=====

The source text for PyMOTW is `reStructuredText <http://docutils.sourceforge.net/>`_ and the HTML and PDF output are created using `Sphinx <http://sphinx.pocoo.org/>`_.

=========

As new articles are written, they are posted to `my blog <http://blog.doughellmann.com/>`_.  Updates are available by `RSS <http://feeds.feedburner.com/PyMOTW>`_ and `email <http://www.feedburner.com/fb/a/emailverifySubmit?feedId=806224&amp;loc=en_US>`_.

Translations and Other Versions
===============================

Spanish
-------

`Ernesto Rico Schmidt <http://denklab.org/>`_ provides a Spanish translation that follows the English version posts. Ernesto is in Bolivia, and is translating these examples as a way to contribute to the members of the `Bolivian Free Software <http://www.softwarelibre.org.bo/>`_ community who use Python.   The full list of articles available in Spanish can be found at http://denklab.org/articles/category/pymotw/, and of course there is an `RSS feed <http://denklab.org/feeds/articles/category/pymotw/>`_.

Chinese
-------

Junjie Cai (蔡俊杰) and Yan Sheng (盛艳) have started a google code project called PyMOTWCN (http://code.google.com/p/pymotwcn/) and posted the completed translations at http://www.vbarter.cn/pymotw/.

Compendiums
-----------

Gerard Flanagan is working on a "Python compendium" called `The Hazel Tree <http://www.thehazeltree.org/>`_.  He is converting a collection of old and new of Python-related reference material into reStructuredText and then building a single searchable repository from the results.  I am very pleased to have PyMOTW included with works from authors like Mark Pilgrim, Fredrik Lundh, Andrew Kuchling, and a growing list of others.
