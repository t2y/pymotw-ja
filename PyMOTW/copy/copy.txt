:Module: copy
:Purpose: Duplicate objects.
:Python Version: 1.4
:Abstract:

    The copy module provides functions for duplicating objects using shallow
    or deep copy semantics.

Description
===========

The copy module includes 2 functions, copy() and deepcopy(), for duplicating
existing objects.

Shallow Copies
==============

The shallow copy created by copy() is a new container populated with
references to the contents of the original object. For example, a new list is
constructed and the elements of the original list are appended to it.

::

    import copy

    class MyClass:
        def __init__(self, name):
            self.name = name
        def __cmp__(self, other):
            return cmp(self.name, other.name)

    a = MyClass('a')
    l = [ a ]
    dup = copy.copy(l)

    print 'l  :', l
    print 'dup:', dup
    print 'dup is l:', (dup is l)
    print 'dup == l:', (dup == l)
    print 'dup[0] is l[0]:', (dup[0] is l[0])
    print 'dup[0] == l[0]:', (dup[0] == l[0])

For a shallow copy, the MyClass instance is not duplicated so the reference in
the dup list is to the same object that is in the l list.

::

    $ python copy_shallow.py
    l  : [<__main__.MyClass instance at 0x78d00>]
    dup: [<__main__.MyClass instance at 0x78d00>]
    dup is l: False
    dup == l: True
    dup[0] is l[0]: True
    dup[0] == l[0]: True


Deep Copies
===========

The deep copy created by deepcopy() is a new container populated with copies
of the contents of the original object. For example, a new list is constructed
and the elements of the original list are copied, then the copies are appended
to the new list.

By replacing the call to copy() with deepcopy(), the difference becomes
apparent.

::

    dup = copy.deepcopy(l)

Notice that the first element of the list is no longer the same object
reference, but the two objects still evaluate as being equal.

::

    $ python copy_deep.py
    l  : [<__main__.MyClass instance at 0x78d28>]
    dup: [<__main__.MyClass instance at 0x78cd8>]
    dup is l: False
    dup == l: True
    dup[0] is l[0]: False
    dup[0] == l[0]: True


Controlling Copy Behavior
=========================

It is possible to control how copies are made using the __copy__ and
__deepcopy__ hooks.

* __copy__() is called without any arguments and should return a shallow copy
  of the object.

* __deepcopy__() is called with a memo dictionary, and should return a deep
  copy of the object. Any member attributes which need to be deep-copied should
  be passed to copy.deepcopy(), along with the memo dictionary, to control for
  recursion (see below).

This example illustrates how the methods are called:

::

    import copy

    class MyClass:
        def __init__(self, name):
            self.name = name
        def __cmp__(self, other):
            return cmp(self.name, other.name)
        def __copy__(self):
            print '__copy__()'
            return MyClass(self.name)
        def __deepcopy__(self, memo):
            print '__deepcopy__(%s)' % str(memo)
            return MyClass(copy.deepcopy(self.name, memo))

    a = MyClass('a')

    sc = copy.copy(a)
    dc = copy.deepcopy(a)

::

    $ python copy_hooks.py
    __copy__()
    __deepcopy__({})


Recursion in Deep Copy
======================

To avoid problems with duplicating recursive data structures, deepcopy() uses
a dictionary to track objects which have already been copied. This dictionary
is passed to the __deepcopy__() method so it can be used there as well.

This example shows how an interconnected data structure such as a Digraph
might assist with protecting against recursion by implementing a
__deepcopy__() method. This particular example is just for illustration
purposes, since the default implementation of deepcopy() already handles the
recursion cases correctly.

First some basic directed graph methods. A graph can be initialized with a
name and a list of existing nodes to which it is connected. The
addConnection() method is used to set up bi-directional connections. It is
also used by the deepcopy operator.

::

    import copy
    import pprint

    class Graph:
        def __init__(self, name, connections):
            self.name = name
            self.connections = connections
        def addConnection(self, other):
            self.connections.append(other)
        def __repr__(self):
            return '<Graph(%s) id=%s>' % (self.name, id(self))

The __deepcopy__() method prints messages to show how it is called, and
manages the memo dictionary contents as needed. Instead of copying the
connection list wholesale, it creates a new list and appends copies of the
individual connections to it. That ensures that the memo dictionary is updated
as each new node is duplicated, and avoids recursion issues or extra copies of
nodes. As before, it returns the copied object when it is done.

::

    def __deepcopy__(self, memo):
        print
        print repr(self)
        not_there = []
        existing = memo.get(self, not_there)
        if existing is not not_there:
            print '  ALREADY COPIED TO', repr(existing)
            return existing
        pprint.pprint(memo, indent=4, width=40)
        dup = Graph(copy.deepcopy(self.name, memo), [])
        print '  COPYING TO', repr(dup)
        memo[self] = dup
        for c in self.connections:
            dup.addConnection(copy.deepcopy(c, memo))
        return dup


Next we can set up a graph with a nodes root, a, and b. The edges are a->root,
b->a, b->root, root->a, root->b.

::

    root = Graph('root', [])
    a = Graph('a', [root])
    b = Graph('b', [a, root])
    root.addConnection(a)
    root.addConnection(b)

    dup = copy.deepcopy(root)

When the root node is copied, we see:

::

    $ python copy_recursion.py

    <Graph(root) id=508592>
    {}
      COPYING TO <Graph(root) id=510792>

    <Graph(a) id=510512>
    {   <Graph(root) id=508592>: <Graph(root) id=510792>,
        488896: 'root',
        497392: ['root']}
      COPYING TO <Graph(a) id=510752>

    <Graph(root) id=508592>
      ALREADY COPIED TO <Graph(root) id=510792>

    <Graph(b) id=510552>
    {   <Graph(root) id=508592>: <Graph(root) id=510792>,
        <Graph(a) id=510512>: <Graph(a) id=510752>,
        237120: 'a',
        488896: 'root',
        497392: [   'root',
                    'a',
                    <Graph(root) id=508592>,
                    <Graph(a) id=510512>],
        508592: <Graph(root) id=510792>,
        510512: <Graph(a) id=510752>}
      COPYING TO <Graph(b) id=530392>

Notice that the second time the root node is encountered, while the a node is
being copied, the recursion is detected and the existing copy is used instead
of a new one.
